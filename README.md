# Bank Telemarketing Analysis
Telemarketing, as a method of direct marketing, has remained popular since the 20th century. Telemarketing is more interactive with consumers than many digital videos and produces measurable results, which help future campaigns. However, poorly executed telemarketing calls may increase the number of rejections and the cost.

This project used machine learning models to help the bank maximize its profit by deciding which customers to call based on its predictions of whether the customers are most likely to subscribe to the term deposits.
